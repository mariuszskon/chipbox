# Building chipbox

Chipbox is designed to be cross-platform and hopefully also easy to build, as long as the target platform is supported by CMake and SDL2. Windows and Linux are the only tested platforms with detailed instructions available below.

## Dependencies
For runtime, you need:

* [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/)

For building, you need:

* An ANSI C compiler capable of linking SDL2 (GCC 7 with make, and Visual Studio Community 2017 were tested)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* SDL2 development libraries

## Build instructions (release)
Firstly make sure you have all of the above dependencies installed! Then you can download this project, either via `git clone` or the Download ZIP option.

### Windows (Visual Studio)
1. Make sure you have CMake in your PATH. If you can run `cmake --help` from cmd without errors, you should be good. The CMake installer for Windows should offer to do this automatically.
2. Make sure you have downloaded and extracted the development libraries for SDL2 in a location you know, in this example, `X:\absolute\path\to\SDL2`
3. Open up a [Developer Command Prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line#developer-command-prompt-shortcuts) to ensure you have all of the right environmental variables set.
4. Run the following commands:

<!-- please ignore -->

    cd path\to\chipbox-master
    build_windows.bat X:\absolute\path\to\SDL2

Then you can run

    dist\bin\testcore

to run the tests, or

    dist\bin\chipbox_sdl "roms\Pong [Paul Vervalin, 1990].ch8"

to run the included Pong ROM.

### Linux

    cd path/to/chipbox-master
    sh build_linux.sh

Then you can run

    dist/bin/testcore

to run the tests, or

    dist/bin/chipbox_sdl "roms/Pong [Paul Vervalin, 1990].ch8"

to run the included Pong ROM.
