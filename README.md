# chipbox

[GitHub](https://github.com/mariuszskon/chipbox/)

A work-in-progress [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter/emulator, written in Standard C (also known as ANSI C or C89) and utilising the wonderful [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/) library for input, graphics and sound.

## Features

* A CHIP-8 interpreter implementing all documented instructions
* Minimalist SDL2 application with visual, audio and input support on many platforms
* Options for switching between different popular interpretations of instructions ("quirks")
* Options for graphics scaling, clock speed, error logging etc.
* Simple disassembler
* Debugging options
* Fancy graphics options, such as blurring and simulating ghosting
* Reusable pure C API

## Prebuilt binaries

You should use these if you can.

[Prebuilt binaries for Windows are available here.](https://github.com/mariuszskon/chipbox/releases)

**NOTE:** This is a _command line application_ meaning double-clicking on the exe will not do what you want - you must run the application from the command line.

If you want a more up to date version, or for any other platform, you must compile it yourself (see `BUILD.md` in the source repository).

## Quick start

chipbox can be simply called in the form `chipbox_sdl rompath` from the command line to use default settings.

The quick start instructions assume you have your command prompt/emulator/terminal open in a directory with a `bin` directory a `roms` directory. The `bin` directory has `chipbox_sdl` and the `roms` directory has `Pong [Paul Vervalin, 1990].ch8`. If you are using the prebuilt binaries and rom pack, make sure you adjust the paths based on where you extracted those.

On Windows:

    bin\chipbox_sdl "roms\Pong [Paul Vervalin, 1990].ch8"

On Linux/Unix-like systems:

    bin/chipbox_sdl "roms/Pong [Paul Vervalin, 1990].ch8"

## Input

The original CHIP-8 keypad looked like this:

    1 2 3 C
    4 5 6 D
    7 8 9 E
    A 0 B F

In chipbox, the keys are mapped to the [scancodes](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Scancode#Remarks) of the following keys:

    1 2 3 4
    Q W E R
    A S D F
    Z X C V

In addition to the classic input keys, chipbox features emulator-specific keys:

* `p` to pause emulation
* `n` to execute the next instruction, if paused

## Options

    Usage: chipbox_sdl [options...] [file]

    Options:
     -h, --help           show this help message
     -s, --scale          set scaling of display
     -b, --blur           if blurring should be applied (yes, no (default))
     -t, --tps            set CHIP-8 ticks/instructions per second
     -m, --mode           set 'mattmik' or 'cowgod' compatibility mode
     -l, --log            set CPU logging level (none, error, warn (default), info)
     -d, --debug          set debug mode ((n)one (default), (e)verything, or a combination of (d)isassemble, (c)ount, (s)creen, (r)egisters, stac(k), (i)nput, (m)emory
     -r, --random         set random seed (default uses system time)
     -g, --ghosting       set the ghosting/burn-in amount (1 is default - no ghosting)
     -p, --pause          begin emulation in paused state

## Building

See `BUILD.md` in the source repository for details.

## ROMs

For your convenience, a large pack of ROMs sourced from [mir3z/chip8-emu](https://github.com/mir3z/chip8-emu) (who in turn got it from the now defunct [chip8.com](http://chip8.com/)) has been included in the source repository. The `roms.json` file provides metadata for the ROMs, such as their author, and possibly instructions for use.

You can grab just the ROMs (without chipbox) from [here](https://github.com/mariuszskon/chipbox/releases/tag/roms).
