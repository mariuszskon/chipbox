# Chipbox

A work-in-progress [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter/emulator, written in ANSI C and utilising the wonderful [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/) library for input, graphics and sound.

## Dependencies
For runtime, you need:

* [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/)

For building, you need:

* An ANSI C compiler capable of linking SDL2 (GCC 7 with make, and Visual Studio Community 2017 were tested)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* SDL2 development libraries

## Build instructions
Firstly make sure you have all of the above dependencies installed, and have downloaded this project, either via `git clone` or the Download ZIP option!

### Windows (Visual Studio)
1. Make sure you have CMake in your PATH. If you can run `cmake --help` from cmd without errors, you should be good. The CMake installer for Windows should offer to do this automatically.
2. Make sure you have downloaded and extracted the development libraries for SDL2 in a location you know, in this example, `path\to\SDL2`
3. Open up a [Developer Command Prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line#developer-command-prompt-shortcuts) to ensure you have all of the right environmental variables set.
4. Run the following commands:
```
cd path\to\chipbox-master
mkdir build && cd build
set SDL2DIR=X:\absolute\path\to\SDL2
cmake ..
msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
```
5. Now you must make the SDL2.dll in the lib directory of the SDL2 development libraries accessible to the binaries. This can be done by copying it to the bin directory of chipbox.
Then you can run
```bin\testcore```
to run the tests, or
```bin\chipbox_sdl "..\roms\Pong [Paul\ Vervalin, 1990].ch8"```
to run the included Pong ROM.

### Linux
```
cd path/to/chipbox-master
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Then you can run
```bin/testcore```
to run the tests, or
```bin/chipbox_sdl "../roms/Pong [Paul\ Vervalin, 1990].ch8"```
to run the included Pong ROM.
