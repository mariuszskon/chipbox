# ROMs

For your convenience, a large pack of ROMs sourced from [mir3z/chip8-emu](https://github.com/mir3z/chip8-emu) (who in turn got it from the now defunct [chip8.com](http://chip8.com/)) has been included. The `roms.json` file provides metadata for the ROMs, such as their author, and possibly instructions for use.
